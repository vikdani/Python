'''1) The Puppy Age Calculator
Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"

Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

 2) The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

 3) The Geometrizer
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

 4)The Temperature Converter

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."'''
